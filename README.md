A multiplayer javaScript snake game with powers and some improvements to style snakes game. This is my second project with socket.io and this is a advanced project to learn and uses much math process with nodejs on backend.
At this moment this project is under development. But we already have a Magnetic power and a Banana food. It's very easy expand foods and powers. It's a very cool project. Feel free to do yours  implementations and sends a merge request.  
  
 Feel free to send sprites to the game. If you are a designer and can contribute free sprites, you are most welcome
